PSDMagnetron
==========

Magnetron is a code to model one-dimensional data (e.g. time series) 
with a superposition of simple shapes. The number of components in the 
superposition is part of the model and need not be known beforehand.

Here, we're going to model power spectra from X-ray photon counting data 
with Lorentzian model shapes.

Dependencies
